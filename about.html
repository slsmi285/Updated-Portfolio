                <p>I am a Full Stack Developer.  I like to think out of the box and build things.</p> 
                <p>I am a graduate of Western Governors University having earned a Bachelors of Science in Business Management.  I soon realized after graduating that I wanted to do something more with my Bachelors Degree.  I have always been interested in technology and always wanted to learn to code.  Vanderbilt University Coding Bootcamp was a perfect choice. The Bachelors Degree and Coding Certification are a perfect combination. I am interested in being a contributing team member, and open to various possibilities.</p>
                
                <p>I love collaborating on ideas, as a former professional wedding photographer, it took collaborating with all vendors and the clients to plan and create the award-winning wedding images that I produced.  Yep, award-winning, locally and internationally!  I still love to photograph, but these days its subjects near and dear to my heart.  I have a bronica-sq, and what I love about it is to think outside the box and to actually calculate the amount of light needed to make the perfect setting, then to get the image setup right, the first time!</p>
                <p>I am currently working on a blog, it has a little bit of everything in it. Non-technical to the newest topic addition - technical.</p>
